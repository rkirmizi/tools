*project_templates is a changed and specialized version of django.conf.project_templaes
it has special timezone, mediaurl, etc.. definitions

*django-create-files creates initial files for a new project such as templates and
media dirs or special dirs like js, css, images as shown on the project_templates.settings.py file
and also creates a base.html file with some block tags

*pylink adds your python modules to your python path. but i preffer to use $PYTHONPATH variable 
in my bashrc file so no need to use sudo or other commands to reach the python path.
